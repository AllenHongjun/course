<h1>Lab: page tables</h1>

<p> In this lab you will explore page tables and modify them to
  simplify the functions to copy data from user space to kernel space.

</p><div class="prereq">
<p>Before you start coding, read Chapter 3 of
  the <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/xv6/book-riscv-rev1.pdf">xv6 book</a>, and related files:

  </p><ul>
    <li> <tt>kern/vm.c</tt>, which contains most virtual memory (VM) code.

    </li><li> <tt>kernel/kalloc.c</tt>, which contains code for allocating and
    freeing physical memory.
  
  </li></ul>

</div>

<p>To start the lab, switch to the pgtbl branch:
  </p><pre>  $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
  $ <kbd>git checkout pgtbl</kbd>
  </pre>
 
<h2>Print page table <script>g("easy")</script>(<a class="easy" href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/labs/guidance.html">easy</a>)</h2>

<div class="required">
  It's often worthwhile to invest time writing code that helps
  debugging, so your first task is to implement a function that prints
  the contents of a page table.  Define the function in kernel/vm.c.
  It should have the following prototype: <tt>void vmprint(pagetable_t)</tt>.
  This function will be handy for debugging and will make you familiar
  with RISC-V page tables.  Insert a call to <tt>vmprint</tt> in
  exec.c to print the page table for the first user process; its
  output should be as below.
</div>

<p>The output of <tt>vmprint</tt> for the first user-level process
  should be as follows:

  </p><pre>page table 0x0000000087f6e000
 ..0: pte 0x0000000021fda801 pa 0x0000000087f6a000
 .. ..0: pte 0x0000000021fda401 pa 0x0000000087f69000
 .. .. ..0: pte 0x0000000021fdac1f pa 0x0000000087f6b000
 .. .. ..1: pte 0x0000000021fda00f pa 0x0000000087f68000
 .. .. ..2: pte 0x0000000021fd9c1f pa 0x0000000087f67000
 ..255: pte 0x0000000021fdb401 pa 0x0000000087f6d000
 .. ..511: pte 0x0000000021fdb001 pa 0x0000000087f6c000
 .. .. ..510: pte 0x0000000021fdd807 pa 0x0000000087f76000
 .. .. ..511: pte 0x000000002000200b pa 0x0000000080008000
  </pre>

The first line displays the argument to <tt>vmprint</tt>.
After that there is a line for each PTE, including PTEs that
refer to page-table pages deeper in the tree.
Each PTE line is indented by a number of <tt>" .."</tt> that indicates its
depth in the tree.
Each PTE line shows the PTE index in its page-table page, the pte bits, and the
physical address extracted from the PTE.
Don't print PTEs that are not valid.  In the above example, the
top-level page-table page has mappings for entries 0 and 255.  The next
level down for entry 0 has only index 0 mapped, and the bottom-level
for that index 0 has entries 0, 1, and 2 mapped.

<p>Some hints:
</p><ul>
  <li>Use the macros at the end of the file kernel/riscv.h.
  </li><li>The function <tt>freewalk</tt> may be inspirational.
  </li><li>Define the prototype for <tt>vmprint</tt> in kernel/defs.h so
  that you can call it from exec.c.
</li></ul>

<div class="question">
Explain the output of <tt>vmprint</tt> in terms of Fig 3-4 from the text.

<h2>Simplify <tt>copyin/copyinstr</tt> <script>g("hard")</script>(<a class="hard" href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/labs/guidance.html">hard</a>)</h2>

<p>
Xv6 uses one page table when executing in the kernel, and a separate
page table for each process when executing user code. The kernel page
table is a direct mapping to physical addresses, so that kernel
virtual address <i>x</i> maps to physical address <i>x</i>. Each of
the xv6 per-process page tables contains only mappings for that
process's user memory, starting at virtual address zero. The kernel
page table does not contain these mappings. Thus, when the kernel
needs to use a user pointer passed in a system call (e.g., the buffer
pointer passed to <tt>write()</tt>), the kernel must first translate
the pointer to a physical address. The kernel does this
with <tt>copyin</tt>, which translates by walking the process
page-table in software, and then accesses user memory via the relevant
physical address.

  </p><div class="required">
Your job is to simplify <tt>copyin</tt> by mapping the current user process
  into the kernel address space so that <tt>copyin</tt> can directly dereference
  user pointers.
    Give each process its own kernel page table and add mappings to
each process's kernel page table so that the following
simplified <tt>copyin</tt> and <tt>copyinstr</tt> work:
<pre>#include "spinlock.h"
#include "proc.h"
int
copyin(pagetable_t pagetable, char *dst, uint64 srcva, uint64 len)
{
  struct proc *p = myproc();
 
  if (srcva+len &gt;= p-&gt;sz || srcva+len &lt; srcva)
    return -1;
  memmove((void *) dst, (void *)srcva, len);
  return 0;
}
</pre>
and <tt>copyinstr</tt> to:
<pre>int
copyinstr(pagetable_t pagetable, char *dst, uint64 srcva, uint64 max)
{
  struct proc *p = myproc();
  char *s = (char *) srcva;

  for(int i = 0; i &lt; max &amp;&amp; srcva + i &lt; p-&gt;sz; i++){
    dst[i] = s[i];
    if(s[i] == '\0')
      return 0;
  }
  return -1;
}
</pre>
Note how much simpler these two implementations are than the existing
ones.  You pass this assignment if <tt>usertests</tt> runs correctly
using the above implementations of the two functions.
</div>

<p>Here are some steps that might be useful:
  
  </p><ol>
    
    <li>Modify <tt>struct proc</tt> to maintain
    a kernel page table for each process, and modify
    the scheduler to switch kernel page tables when switching
    processes. For this step, each per-process kernel page table
    should be identical to the existing global kernel page table.

    </li><li>Map the user process's memory in the bottom part of the
    process's kernel page table.
      
  </li></ol>

<p>
This scheme relies on the user virtual address range not overlapping
the range of virtual addresses that the kernel uses for its own instructions
and data. Xv6 uses virtual addresses that start at zero for
user address spaces, and luckily the kernel's memory starts at higher
addresses.
However, 
this scheme does limit the maximum size of a user process to be less than
the kernel's lowest virtual address.
That address is <tt>0x2000000</tt> in xv6, the address of
the CLINT registers;
see <tt>kvminit()</tt> in <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt>,
<tt>kernel/memlayout.h</tt>, and Figure 3-4 in the text. You'll need
to modify xv6 to prevent user processes from growing larger than this
limit. (It turns out that xv6 only uses the CLINT very early in the
boot sequence, so it's OK to map over it if you want to; the next most
restrictive address is the PLIC at <tt>0xC000000</tt>.)

 </p><p>Read the book chapter and code mentioned at the start of this
   assignment; it will be hard to modify the virtual memory
   code correctly without an understanding of how it works.
   You'll also need to understand the existing code in order to 
   debug your lab. Bugs in page table setup can cause traps
   due to missing mappings, can
   cause loads and stores to affect unexpected pages
   of physical memory, and can cause execution of instructions from
   incorrect pages of memory.

</p><p>Some hints for step 1:
</p><ul>
  <li>Add a field to <tt>struct proc</tt> for the process's kernel
  page table.
  </li><li>Create and fill in the process's kernel page table when creating a process
  in <tt>fork</tt>. See <tt>kvminit</tt> for what should be
in a kernel page table.
  </li><li>Modify <tt>scheduler()</tt> to load the process's kernel page table into
  the core's <tt>satp</tt> register (see <tt>kvminithart</tt> for
  inspiration).
  </li><li>You'll need to use the existing <tt>kernel_pagetable</tt> when
  no process is running, specifically in <tt>scheduler()</tt>.
  </li><li>Free a process's kernel page table when the process exists.
  </li><li><tt>vmprint</tt> may come in handy to debug page tables.
  </li><li>It's OK to modify xv6 functions or add new functions; you'll
      probably need to do this in at least <tt>kernel/vm.c</tt>
      and <tt>kernel/proc.c</tt>.
</li></ul>

<p>Some hints for step 2:
  </p><ul>
    <li>In <tt>fork</tt>, map the new process's user memory into the process's kernel
    page table. Think about the permissions in each PTE.

    </li><li>Update a process's kernel page table when the process's user
    page table changes (e.g., <tt>exec</tt>, <tt>sbrk</tt>, etc.)

    </li><li>Replace <tt>copyin</tt> with the simplified code shown above,
    and make sure <tt>usertests</tt> works.
      
    </li><li>Once you pass usertests with the new <tt>copyin</tt>, use
    the new <tt>copyinstr</tt>.
      
</li></ul>

<p>
  Linux uses a technique similar to what you have implemented.
  Until a few years ago many kernels used the same per-process
  page table in both user and kernel space, with mappings for
  both user and kernel addresses, to avoid having to switch
  page tables when switching between user and kernel space.
  However, that setup allowed
  side-channel attacks such as Meltdown and Spectre.

</p><div class="question">
<p>Explain why the second test <tt>srcva + len &lt; srcva</tt> is necessary
in <tt>copyin()</tt>: give concrete values for which the first test
(<tt>srcva+len &gt;= p-&gt;z</tt>) fails but for which the second one is true.

<h2>Optional challenge exercises</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Use super-pages to reduce the number of PTEs in page tables.

  </li><li>Extend your solution to support user programs that are as large
  as possible; that is, eliminate the restriction that user
  programs be smaller than CLINT (or PLIC, or any other small limit).

  </li><li>Unmap the first page of a user process so that dereferencing a
  null pointer will result in a fault.  You will have to start the
  user text segment at, for example, 4096, instead of 0.
