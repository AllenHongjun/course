On every June 1st, the Children's Day, there will be a game named "crashing balloon" on TV.
&nbsp; The rule is very simple.&nbsp; On the ground there are 100 labeled 
balloons, with the numbers 1 to 100.&nbsp; After the referee shouts "Let's go!"
the two players, who each starts with a score of&nbsp; "1", race to crash
the balloons by their feet and, at the same time,
multiply their scores by the numbers written on the balloons they crash.&nbsp;
After a minute, the little audiences are allowed to take the remaining balloons away, 
and each contestant reports his\her score, the product of the numbers
on the balloons he\she's crashed.&nbsp; The unofficial winner is the player who
announced the highest score.
<p>Inevitably, though, disputes arise, and so the official winner is not
determined until the disputes are resolved.&nbsp; The player who claims
the lower score is entitled to challenge his\her opponent's score.&nbsp; The
player with the lower score is presumed to have told the truth, because
if he\she were to lie about his\her score, he\she would surely come up with a bigger
better lie.&nbsp; The challenge is upheld if the player with the higher
score has a score that cannot be achieved with balloons not crashed by the
challenging player.&nbsp; So, if the challenge is successful, the player
claiming the lower score wins.
<p>So, for example, if one player claims 343 points and the other claims
49, then clearly the first player is lying; the only way to score 343 is
by crashing balloons labeled 7 and 49, and the only way to score 49 is by crashing
a balloon labeled 49.&nbsp; Since each of two scores requires crashing the
balloon labeled 49, the one claiming 343 points is presumed to be lying.
<p>On the other hand, if one player claims 162 points and the other claims
81, it is possible for both to be telling the truth (e.g. one crashes balloons
2, 3 and 27, while the other crashes balloon 81), so the challenge would not
be upheld.
<p>By the way, if the challenger made a mistake on calculating his/her score, 
then the challenge would not be upheld.  If none of them are telling
the truth, the challenge would not be upheld.
<p>Unfortunately, anyone who is willing to referee a game of crashing balloon is
likely to get over-excited in the hot atmosphere that 
he\she could not reasonably be expected to perform the intricate calculations
that refereeing requires.&nbsp; Hence the need for you, sober programmer,
to provide a software solution.
<h1>
<tt><font size="+1">Input</font></tt></h1>
Pairs of unequal, positive numbers, with each pair on a single line, that
are claimed scores from a game of crashing balloon.
<h1>
<tt><font size="+1">Output</font></tt></h1>
Numbers, one to a line, that are the winning scores, assuming that the
player with the lower score always challenges the outcome.
